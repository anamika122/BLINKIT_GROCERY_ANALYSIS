# Blinkit Grocery Analysis

## Project Objective

Blinkit, a reputed online grocery store, harnesses the power of data analysis using Excel to make informed, data-driven decisions.I use Excel to track sales trends, analyze customer behavior, and identify areas for improvement. I analyze sales data for specific product categories and compare sales figures across different outlets to pinpoint areas that require focused efforts for increasing sales.

## Dataset used
